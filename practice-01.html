		<h1 align="center">About It firm</h1>
				<p><b><em>An IT Firm is a company that provides direct IT support, IT management, infrastructure services or physical and network/data security services to companies that do not have the ability or desire to hire internal IT employees or who’s IT employees do not have the knowledge or training required.<br><br>

Some companies may specialize in the infrastructure side of things such as network and telephony wiring, installation and configuration of routers, switches and firewalls, configuring communication protocols over the network etc., while others may specialize more so in direct support or management of IT operations such as day to day management of File and print servers, active directory, DNS and email management. Others may simply provide consultation and management of IT projects that a company’s internal IT team does not have the time, ability or skillset to manage.<br>

Most any IT firm will have a solid sales team that drives the business and generates the workload the technicians, system/network administrators and project managers work.

When I worked for a “Managed Services” company, another way to say “IT Firm”, we provided all of the above services. There were basically 4 teams or departments that comprised the company.<br><br>

There was the Business Development team, more informally recognized as the sales team. These are the folks who spend their days contacting colleagues , following leads, making cold calls and driving the sales, i.e. business, and have the ability to earn some really big bucks by landing large contracts. They are responsible for maintaining the day to day business flow by building securing long-term IT management contracts and service agreements or one time installations of hardware, infrastructure or voice services, etc.<br>

Then there was the Telephony & Communications team which installed, managed and configured server and cloud based VoIP systems, PBX systems and did the majority of the network wiring runs. Office A doesn’t have enough wall jacks to support another user with a VoIP phone and Desktop PC? The Telco folks would usually be the ones who would perform those cable runs to support additional users and devices in an area or in network/office remodels or new builds. Customer service and communications skills are just as important to knowledge of the systems and devices they support or maintain as they work directly with the customer(s) after the contracts or agreements have been signed.<br><br>

I served as the IT Infrastructure Manager and my team was responsible for remote and on-site support of desktop/laptop and peripheral devices, server installation/management, router and firewall installation/management, MS exchange configuration and management, data backup and disaster recovery, and security and network auditing services. We occasionally assisted the Telco team with cable runs on large projects and required their input when configuring protocols and port availability etc. for telephony or communications equipment. Again, for my team, customer service and communications skills were just as important to knowledge of the systems and devices they supported or maintained.<br><br>

Last but in no way least, there was the Admin and/or Operations team. They are the HR folks, accounts payables/accounts receivables folks, the office managers and administrators, secretaries/assistants etc. that made sure the back end of the business functioned so that the other teams could do their jobs knowing they would be able to go to the doc, get a paycheck, the lights would stay on, the customer was billed, etc. I am sure folks from the other teams could mostly manage these functions but it would take away from their ability to focus on the needs of their customers.<br></em></b>
